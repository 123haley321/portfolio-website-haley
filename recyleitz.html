            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>    
            <p>
                RecycleItz is a web application where the primary goal is to make the process of recycling easier for its users 
                with this problem statement is mind: Users need a way to know where to go to recycle, as well as the ability to 
                bring the recycling to the centers with little to no contamination, so that when it is sent to a sorting center, 
                it will be recycled and not sent to the landfills. We will know this to be true, when 75% of the recycling that is 
                brought to the centers is sent to be recycled and not thrown away. The process started with researching what the 
                current issues were within the recycling industry, by interviewing people who both recycle and do not recycle, to 
                test if the hypothesis were true. The research gathered was used to create wireframes and a prototype that would 
                help with the struggles people were having with the recycling process. The prototype was used to test if the usability 
                was working properly.  Lastly, higher fidelity wireframes were created after learning more about the different UI 
                principals.

        <h3>INSPIRATION PHASE</h3>    
        <p>
            The process began with the Inspiration Phase. This phase included the following: brainstorming problems/solutions, 
            competitive analysis and the functionalities of the application.
        </p>  
            <img src="img/recyleitz/inspiration-2.jpg" alt="Inspiration Image">
        <p>
            These are some of the main problems with the recycling industry right now.
        </p>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/painpoints-2.jpg">    
        <p>
            Through brainstorming some of the problems and solutions, this helped to create a Problem 
            Statement that would  be solved throughout the creation of this application. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="center">Problem Statement</h3>

            To learn more about what the competition was for recycling applications, a completive analysis was done on the 
            following apps:

            <img src="img/recyleitz/swotanalysisrecyclecoach-2.jpg" alt="SWOT for RecycleCoach"> 
        <h3>Learned from Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The Recycling industry is a relatively new field in terms of app development.  The apps in this 
            field, were either very specific to their geographical area and/or only have very specific features included.  
            Although this was good, because this meant that the app had a strong possibility of being successful, it also came 
            with its challenges. It was a little bit difficult to draw inspiration from an almost untapped market.  This meant 
            creativity had to be used when creating the designs for this app. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="center">Executive Summary</h3>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/executivesummary-2.jpg" alt="Executive Summary"> 
        <p>
            From the research, some user stories were created in order to start building empathy with the potential users of this application. 
        </p>
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
           <img src="img/recyleitz/userstories-2.jpg" alt="User Stories"> 
        <h3>CONCEPTUALIZATION PHASE</h3>  
            <img src="img/recyleitz/conceptualization-2.jpg" alt="Conceptualization Image"> 
        <p>
            To get a better idea of what people were thinking on the topic of recycling, I conducted both surveys and interviews. These were some of the main takeaways: 
        </p>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/feedback-2.jpg" alt="Feedback">
        <p>
            Using the information gathered from the surveys and interviews 2 personas were created to emphasize empathy in the 
            design process. The personas were named Sara and Mike.  Lets focus on Sara. 
        </p>
            <h3>Persona</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/persona-2.jpg" alt="Persona">
        <P>
            Sara has made the decision to start recycling.  Her goals are to know where and how to recycle, and she wants to 
            feel confident that the process is being done correctly.Here is what her journey map and mental model would look like 
            during this process. 
        </P>
        <h3>Journey Map</h3>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/journeymap-2.jpg" alt="Journey Map"> 
        <h3>Mental Model</h3> 
                <img src="img/recyleitz/mentalmodel-2.jpg" alt="Mental Model"> 
        <p>
            Next, user flows for tasks that Sara and Mike would be completing while using the app were created. 
            Here is an example of a task that Sara would complete while using RecycleItz: Sara has prepared her recycling.  
            She now needs to know where to go. 
        </p>
        <h3>Userflow</h3>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/userflow-2.jpg" alt="Userflow"> 
        <h3>ITERATION PHASE</h3>
        <p>
            Next, the process continued to the Iteration Phase. This portion of the project, focuses on creating 
            prototypes and testing. 
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/iteration-2.jpg" alt="Iteration image"> 
        <p>
            Keeping Sara and Mike in mind, a site map was created to help with the organization of the entire application. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/sitemap1-2.jpg" alt="Sitemap v1"> 
        <p>
            Google Drawings was used on the first attempt at creating a site map.  Then a card sorting activity was conducted 
            using OptimalSort to get a better idea of what others thought belonged in each section. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Card Sorting Results</h3>
            <img src="img/recyleitz/cardsorting-2.jpg" alt="Card Sorting"> 
        <p>
            From the card sorting people wanting to be able to get the paid version of the app in the profile section, and 
            see multiple items within that same page was determined. After getting the results from my Card Sorting activity, 
            as well as other research, another version of the  sitemap was created. This sitemap was created using FigJam. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Final Version of Sitemap</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/sitemap2-2.jpg" alt="Sitemap v2"> 
        <p>
            Then came the time to start designing the screens. There were 3 main features to focus on for my prototypes. Those 
            features were:
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/features-2.jpg" alt="Sitemap v2"> 
        <p>
            For now, lets focus on the process of the creation of the Where to Recycle wireframes. 
        </p>
        <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/lowfidelitywireframes-2.jpg" alt="Low-fidelity Wireframes"> 
        <p>
            The low-fidelity wireframes were then transposed into Figma. 
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/midfidelitywireframes-2.jpg" alt="Transposed Wireframes"> 
        <p>
            Before usability testing, the wireframes were updated to a more mid-fidelity to be understood by the testers. 
        </p>
        <h3>Mid-fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/midfidelitywireframeswords-2.jpg" alt="Transposed Wireframes"> 
        <h3>Usabilty Testing</h3>
        <p>
            The information from the usability testing was sorted into categories that would be useful in making updates to the wireframes. 
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/stickynotes1-2.jpg" alt="Sticky Notes"> 
                <img src="img/recyleitz/stickynotes2-2.jpg" alt="Sticky Notes"> 
        <p>
            These were the main conclusions from the Usabilty Testing: 
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/maintakeaways-2.jpg" alt="Takeaways">
        <p>
            The Rainbow spreadsheet was used to decide what items needed to be fixed to make my application more user friendly.
        </p>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/rainbow-2.jpg" alt="Rainbow Spreadsheet"> 
        <h5>Main issues with Prototype</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>People were clicking on connect with others to get to the community initiatives section</li>
                <li>People were looking for  “where is my recycling” in the Profile section.</li>
                <li>Add other options to confirm recycling is correct, other than confirming with a photo.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Using the data from the Rainbow Spreadsheet, the wireframes were updated. One issue was that people were looking 
            for where is my recycling in the profile section.
        </p>
        <h3 class="center">Before</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/communityinnitiativesbefore-2.jpg" alt="Wireframe Before"> 
        <h3 class="center">After</h3>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/communityinnitiativesafter-2.jpg" alt="Wireframe After"> 
        <p>
            Finally, I started making high-fidelity wireframes. To do this, it was most beneficial to get an opinion 
            from people on what kind of illustration they prefer for the application. Preference testing was conducted 
            using UsabilityHub.  60% of my testers preferred Version 2.
        </p>
       
        <div>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/splashscreenoptions-2.jpg" alt="Splashscreen Options"> 
        </div>
        <p>
            Because of the results received from the preference testing; these were some of the screens that were used for Onboarding:
        </p>
        <div>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/onboarding1-2.jpg" alt="Onboarding v1"> 
        </div>
        <p>
            One of the most challenging parts of this project was the learning of UI Design. The Splash screen didn't fit the 
            typical design of a splash screen and the onboarding screens did look like they all belonged together.  Using what 
            was learned from the preference testing an animated look was used, but with illustrations that looked more uniform. 
            This was the result:
        </p>
        <div>
                <img src="img/recyleitz/onboarding2-2.jpg" alt="Onboarding v2">
        </div>
        <p>
            Then it was time to make iterations.  The Principals of Hierarchy, Law of Good Continuation,  Balance and Law of 
            Similarity were used to make these iterations., as well as the help from other UX Designers on how to best make updates 
            to my current wireframes. Continuing with the theme of the where to recycle screens, this is what the progression of what the map screen looked like over time. 
        </p>

        <h3>EXPOSITION PHASE</h3>
        <p>Last, this entire summary of this project has been the Exposition phase, which includes the presentation and story telling aspect.</p>
